"Delicious Delights: Unleashing the Power of Data in Online Food Delivery"

Objective: The objective of this case study is to analyze the data from an online food delivery app
to gain insights into customer behavior, restaurant performance, and revenue growth. 
We aim to answer various questions related to customer orders, restaurant popularity, revenue growth,
customer preferences, and more.

Schema Design: The database schema consists of the following tables:

1)users$: Contains information about app users.
2)delivery_partner$: Stores details of delivery partners.
3)food$: Holds information about different food items.
4)menu$: Represents the menu items available in restaurants.
5)restaurants$: Contains information about restaurants.
6)orders$: Stores details of customer orders.
7)order_details$: Holds information about individual food items in each order.

In this project, we begin by cleaning the data, treating null values, and modifying the data types wherever required. 
We then proceed to explore the data by querying the tables and answering specific questions.

The questions addressed in this case study are as follows:

1)Finding customers who have never ordered.
2)Calculating the average price per dish.
3)Identifying the top restaurant in terms of the number of orders.
4)Finding the top restaurant in terms of the number of orders in a given month.
5)Identifying restaurants with monthly sales greater than 500 in June.
6)Showing all orders with order details for a particular customer within a specific date range.
7)Finding restaurants with the maximum number of repeated customers.
8)Analyzing month-over-month revenue growth for the platform.
9)Determining customer names and their favorite food items.

Throughout the project, SQL queries are used to extract relevant information from the database.
The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, providing insights into customer behavior,
restaurant performance, revenue growth, and customer preferences.

Overall, this project showcases the power of data analysis in the online food delivery 
industry and highlights the potential insights that can be gained from analyzing customer and restaurant data.
